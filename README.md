# Web Application for Online Food Order

## Project Overview

A simple web application for the demonstration of Rest API, Database handling, Dynamic content loading, Isolated design and error handling

## Key Features

1. **Rest API**: Backend design follow the principle of that each request from the client to the server is independent
2. **Isolated Backend-Frontend**: The server-side and client-side of a web application are kept separate and communicate through APIs.
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Ensuring the app can continue to function even if an error happens without crashing the app.
4. **Dynamic Content Loading in Frontend**: Display content dynamically based on user actions or external data without reloading the entire page.
